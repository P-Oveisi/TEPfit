Haemodynamic-EEG Connectome-Based Whole-Brain Model
===================================================

Summary
-------

''fewbm'' is a Python library that includes a working project towards developing a  
multimodal, connectome-based, whole-brain model that uses deep learning algorithms
to fit empirical data to model in order to get biologically-representative 
parameters. This is in contrast to the conventional brute-force and exhaustive 
methods of parameter search
